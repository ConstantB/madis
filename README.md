# madis

madIS is an extensible relational database system built on top of the SQLite database with extensions implemented in Python (via APSW SQLite wrapper).

In usage, madIS, feels like Hive (Hadoop's SQL with User Defined Functions language), without the overhead but also without the distributed processing capabilities. Nevertheless madIS can easily handle tens of millions of rows on a single desktop/laptop computer.

madIS' main goal is to promote the handling of data related tasks within an extended relational model. In doing so, it upgrades the database, from having a support role (storing and retrieving data), to being a full data processing system on its own. madIS comes with functions for file import/export, keyword analysis, data mining tasks, fast indexing, pivoting, statistics and workflow execution.

madIS was designed and implemented by a small team of developers at the MaDgIK lab of the University of Athens, under the supervision of professor Yannis Ioannidis.
